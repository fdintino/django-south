===========
South 0.8.1
===========

This is the first bugfix release in the 0.8 series, to address a critical
regression on older versions of Django.

Major changes are outlined below. A full list of changes can be found on
`the repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewgodwin/south/commits/all/>`_.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None


Django 1.4 regression
=====================

There was a critical regression with South 0.8 and any version of
Django below 1.5 due to a misimplementation of the index_together code -
this has now been fixed.

keep_default fully deprecated
=============================

The keep_default argument to add_column has been working differently
in different backends for a while, so it is now ignored everywhere
and defaults are never kept in the database.
