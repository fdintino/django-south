None.


Major changes
=============

South tests
-----------

South's internal test suite now doesn't run by default (the ``SKIP_SOUTH_TESTS``
setting now defaults to True). This is mainly because the test suite is meant
to be run in isolation (the test framework continually changes
``INSTALLED_APPS`` and fiddles with the ORM as it runs, among other things), and
was causing compatability problems with other applications.

If you wish to run the tests still, simply set ``SKIP_SOUTH_TESTS = False``.
