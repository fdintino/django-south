=========
South 0.8
=========

This is a new major release of South, and probably the last major release
before work begins on South 2 as part of the ongoing work with schema alterations
in Django. Don't worry - an upgrade path will be provided.

We recommend that you pin your South requirement in your requirements file
to `south < 2.0`, however, so you will not be auto-upgraded when the time comes.

Major changes are outlined below. A full list of changes can be found on
`the repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewgodwin/south/commits/all/>`_.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None


Python 2.x support
==================

South is now only compatable with Python 2.6 and higher. If you are still
on 2.5 on below, you will have to use the 0.7.x releases of South - do not
expect those to be maintained any further, however.


Python 3
========

South now has alpha support for Python 3, thanks to the `six` library
and the work of Aymeric Augustin. This is intended to complement the
support in Django 1.5 and up; please report any issues you come across
when using it.


index_together
==============

South now supports the index_together option for models found in
Django 1.5 and up.
