South documentation
===================

South is a tool to provide consistent, easy-to-use and database-agnostic
migrations for Django applications.

This is the documentation for the current version (0.7); previous versions'
documentation was written directly into our wiki, but is mostly a subset of
what is written here.

If you want to view the old docs (for example, if you need something that was
only in 0.6) they're `still available <http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/OldDocumentation>`_.
