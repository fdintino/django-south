South documentation
===================

South is a tool to provide consistent, easy-to-use and database-agnostic
migrations for Django applications.

This is the documentation for the current version (0.7); previous versions'
documentation was written directly into our wiki, but is a subset of what is
written here. Any new features are marked as such.
